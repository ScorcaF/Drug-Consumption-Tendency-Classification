# Drug-Consumption-Tendency-Classification



The focus is on an individual tendency to assume LSD, basing on psychological, social, individual, environmental, and economic factors. This objective allows deepening the mathematical and algorithmic foundations of the following tools.

Data exploration: boxplots, occurrences counts, features correlation
Data preparation: Outliers detection, Principal Component Analysis, Fisher Linear Discriminant Analysis, Oversampling.
Training and k-fold Cross-Validation: SVM, KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest.

The best performing model (SVM) reached an f1-score of 0.70, and results showed that, for the proposed classification task, outliers removal and dimensionality reduction were secondary with respect to hyper-parameters tuning.
